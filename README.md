# ising-model

## Overview
The Ising model is an interesting statistical mechanical model, which has suprisingly complex properties. I will be building a collection of jupyter notebooks which explore the different properties of Ising models.

## Current Notebooks
- Calculation of Binder Cumulant
- Critical Slowing-Down Near Phase Transition
- Self-Learning Monte Carlo using Deep Learning for Hysteresis in 2D Ising
- Brute Force Density of States for 1D Ising
